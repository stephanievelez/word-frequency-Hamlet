<h1>Hamlet translated in 3 languages </h1>
In this project, data from translated versions of Hamlet was used to analyze and graphed using matplotlib library
Word frequencies are graphed according to each translation (English, Portuguese, German)
First, a function is made counting the words in the text for each language
Another function is made where the length of the word is defined and then grouped on how frequent it is in the script.
The number of words according to their length for each language is then plotted using matplotlib
